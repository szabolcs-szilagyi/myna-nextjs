Transitioning from summer to fall is our speciality — our perfect blend! It is easy to get trapped in the mindset of compulsive buying, but we are here to encourage you to make choices that impact you and our planet positively.<0></0>Are you ready to see how we style our summer collection pieces effortlessly into fall?<0></0>Come, have a look! We will show you how to increase the cost per wear of your clothes.<0></0>Stay inspired, with Mynalabel.",
  "believe-text": "<0>Our \"Winged, but rooted\" AW2022 collection is an ode to the contemporary queen. Each piece is thoughtfully designed to reflect the feminine qualities of the conscious woman while accentuating her natural beauty: inside out.</0>",
  "believe-text-two": "<0>LINA scarf, which was meticulously handcrafted by our Creative Designer and Founder, Justyna Lysak, is a Mynalabel statement piece this season. Each white, non-violent (peace) silk fabric piece is first outlined with a waterproof base and then painted one brushstroke at a time. To permanently set the colours, this process is followed by steaming and washing. The edges are then carefully curled in and sewn.</0>",
