            <h1 className="text-center mt-5 mb-3">OUR STORY</h1>
            <p>Fashion was always deep in my heart and evolved to the moment when I didn't wanted to participate anymore in the fast fashion trend. From a very young age, I loved beauty. But I don't want to leave a negative impact on the world. I want to transform the fashion world.</p>
            <p>That's how Myna came about. I was introduced to sustainable fashion by my very old friend who started Mynalabel together with me. The idea was to create label which care about environment and preserves the world for our children. Since than I want to wear clothes that are made by honest wage earners, not transported halfway across the world. I have own vision in style, which I couldnâ€™t find elsewhere. I was searching for feminine forms inspired by romantic&timeless designs, which I will love for years.</p>
            <p>Thanks to Myna, I have fulfilled my dream that started when I was a little girl learning sewing from my mother. The day I graduated from the London College of Fashion, I knew this was not the end of fulfilling my dreams. Once I had saved up enough money, and my kids had grown up a bit, I could finally realize my dream of creating an ethical and Eco-friendly clothing brand.</p>
            <p>We love timeless fashion and living in harmony with nature. My mother is my biggest fan and we inspire each other's creativity. I hope my fashion can inspire you too.</p>
